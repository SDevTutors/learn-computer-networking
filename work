## Question 1 [Total Marks: 25]

### Question 1(a) [4 Marks]

Explain the difference between an analogue and a digital signal. Give two examples of each.

**Analogue Signal:**
- Varies continuously over time.
- Can take any value within a given range.
- **Examples:** Sound waves, Radio waves.

**Digital Signal:**
- Has discrete levels or values.
- Typically represented by binary 0s and 1s.
- **Examples:** Digital clock, Computer data.

### Question 1(b) [7 Marks]

A sine wave is described by:

\[ y(t) = 2 \sin(6284t + \frac{\pi}{4} \text{rads}) \]

Sketch the sine wave, clearly labelling each axis with appropriate units.

1. **Amplitude (A):** 2
2. **Frequency (f):** \( \frac{6284}{2\pi} \approx 1000 \) Hz
3. **Phase (\(\phi\)):** \( \frac{\pi}{4} \) radians

- **Y-axis:** Amplitude (V)
- **X-axis:** Time (ms)

The sketch will show a sine wave oscillating with a peak amplitude of 2V, a frequency of 1kHz, and a phase shift of \(\frac{\pi}{4}\).

### Question 1(c) [6 Marks]

If the sine wave in part (b) above was sampled at 10kHz, what would be the first 3 sample values?

Sampling rate: 10kHz (sampling period \( T_s \) = 0.1ms)

First 3 sample times: \( t_0 = 0 \), \( t_1 = 0.1 \)ms, \( t_2 = 0.2 \)ms

Calculate \( y(t) \) at these times:

\[ y(0) = 2 \sin \left( \frac{\pi}{4} \right) \]
\[ y(0.1 \text{ms}) = 2 \sin \left( 6284 \times 0.1 \times 10^{-3} + \frac{\pi}{4} \right) \]
\[ y(0.2 \text{ms}) = 2 \sin \left( 6284 \times 0.2 \times 10^{-3} + \frac{\pi}{4} \right) \]

### Question 1(d) [8 Marks]

A system generates a 2V peak to peak square wave with a period of 1ms. Sketch the frequency spectrum of the system output.

1. **Fundamental Frequency (f0):** 1kHz
2. **Harmonics:** Odd multiples of the fundamental frequency (3kHz, 5kHz, ...)

The amplitude of each harmonic decreases with frequency. Sketch will show the fundamental at 1kHz and the diminishing amplitudes of the odd harmonics.

## Question 2 [Total Marks: 25]

### Question 2(a) [4 Marks]

Explain the difference between the bit rate and the baud of a system.

**Bit Rate:** 
- The number of bits transmitted per second (bps).

**Baud Rate:** 
- The number of signal units transmitted per second.
- Can represent more than one bit per signal unit in higher-order modulation schemes.

### Question 2(b) [5 Marks]

A system transmits at a bit rate of 1Gbps using 16 signalling levels per symbol. What is the baud of the system?

- **Bit rate (R):** 1Gbps = 1 \times 10^9 bps
- **Signalling levels (M):** 16

Baud rate \( = \frac{\text{Bit rate}}{\log_2(\text{Signalling levels})} \)

### Question 2(c) [4 Marks]

A low pass channel has a bandwidth of 200kHz. Assuming zero noise, what is the maximum capacity of this channel?

Using the Shannon-Hartley theorem: \( C = B \log_2(1 + S/N) \)

For zero noise, \( C = B \log_2(1) = 200 \text{kHz} \times \log_2(2) = 200 \text{kHz} \)

### Question 2(d) [12 Marks]

![Figure 1](figure-1.jpeg)

>Figure 2(d) â€“ Transmission system 

A data transmission system launches 45mW of power into a cable from transmitter, TX. The cable is 20km in length and has a loss of 2.5dB per kilometre. The signal is then amplified using an amplifier with 10dB gain before being transmitted via a second cable of length 10km with a loss of 2dB per kilometre. What is the received power level in watts at Rx?

Calculate power loss and gain through each segment:

1. **First cable:** 45mW, 20km, 2.5dB/km
2. **Amplifier:** 10dB gain
3. **Second cable:** 10km, 2dB/km

Use the dB conversion formula \( P_{dB} = 10 \log_{10}(P_{mW}) \) to find the received power.

## Question 3 [Total Marks: 25]

### Question 3(a) [10 Marks]

Draw the constellation diagram for the following modulation schemes:

1. ASK with peak amplitude values of 1V and 3V.
2. QPSK with a peak amplitude value of 1V and any suitable phases.

Ensure that the axes of all diagrams are labelled to show signal amplitudes.

### Question 3(b) [6 Marks]

How many bits can fit on a 1.5km link if the propagation speed is 2.4 x \( 10^{8} \) m/sec and the bit rate is 25Mb/sec? 

Calculate the propagation delay and the number of bits that fit within that time.

### Question 3(c) [9 Marks]

A data transmission scheme is to transmit the following binary data stream:  

\[ 01 \ 1100\ 1010 \]

Assume the last signal level has been positive. Draw the graph of the output signal for the following coding schemes:

1. **Manchester**
2. **AMI**
3. **NRZ-L**

## Question 4 [Total Marks: 25]

### Question 4(a) [4 Marks]

What is the main advantage of Return to Zero (RZ) line coding schemes, for example Manchester Encoding, over Non-Return to Zero (NRZ) line coding schemes such as NRZ-I? How is this advantage achieved?

**Advantage:** 
- Easier to synchronize as there is a transition for each bit.

### Question 4(b) [2 Marks]

Calculate the RMS Voltage of the following sine wave:

\[ V(t) = 312 \sin(314t + 1.1 \text{rad}) \]

RMS value of sine wave \( = \frac{A}{\sqrt{2}} \).

### Question 4(c) [9 Marks]

Write brief notes explaining any **three** of the following wireless terms:

1. Atmospheric absorption
2. Multipath
3. Reflection
4. Scattering
5. Inter-symbol interference (ISI)

### Question 4(d) [10 Marks]

A dish antenna operates at 2.4GHz with a gain of 7.1dBi. Calculate the effective area of the antenna.

Use the formula for effective area \( A_{eff} = \frac{\lambda^2}{4\pi} \times 10^{G/10} \), where \( \lambda = \frac{c}{f} \).
