## Question 1 [Total Marks: 25]

### Question 1(a)

A sinusoidal signal $x(t)$ is described by the equation:

$$x(t) = -4.25 \sin(2750t + 1.6)$$

1. What is the frequency of the signal?
2. Sketch the signal for $0 \leq t \leq 3$ msec.  
3. If the signal was delayed by 0.5 msec, write out the new equation for the signal.
