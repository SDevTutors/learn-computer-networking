Q 1(b)

Signals can be viewed in the time domain or the frequency domain.

Explain the concepts of time domain and frequency domain.
Explain how a frequency domain view could be generated from a time series
representation of a signal.

Q 1(a)
A sinusoidal signal x(t) is described by the equation
x(t) =- 4.2sin(2750t + 1.6)
What is the frequency of the signal?
Sketch the signal for (0 ≤ t ≤3msec)
If the signal was delayed by 0.5 msec write out the new equation for the signal
