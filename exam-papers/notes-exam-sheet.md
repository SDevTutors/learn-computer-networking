Sine Wave:  Period = T=1f	yt=2sin(6284t+π4rads) 	where a = 2, f = 62842π,  phase = π4	

Baud Rate: Bit Ratelog2(Number of signalling levels)		Bit Rate = 1Gbps=1 ×109bps, 			

Baud Rate = 1×109log2(16)= 1×1094=250 × 106 baud       Number of signal levels = 16

Shannon Hartley theorem: C=Blog2(1+SNRlinear)    where B = bandwidth SNR linear = 10(SNR10) 

C = Channel capacity

Loss = a×d where a=attenuation & d=distance

P received = P transmitted – L total  		 Preceived=22dBm-12dB=10dBm

Converting power dBm(milliwatts) to Watts =  10(PdBm10)×10-3=W

Calculate number of levels: R=B . log2M where M=no. of levels, R=bitrate, B=Bandwitdh

\*M should be given as a power of 2 with the power rounded up to nearest w. number

RMS voltage of a sine wave = Vrms= Vm2  where Vm is the peak voltage(amplitude)

Effective area of antenna = Aeff= W2Glin4π  where Aeff=effective area, W=3×108m/sf Glin=10GdBi10
