**Requirements for this paper:**  

1. Log Tables
2. Calculators

## Question 1 [Total Marks: 25]

### Question 1(a) [4 Marks]

Explain the difference between an analogue and a digital signal.  Give two examples of each.

### Question 1(b) [7 Marks]

A sine wave is described by:

$$y(t) = 2sin(6284t + \frac{\pi}{4}\text{rads})$$

Sketch the sine wave, clearly labelling each axis with appropriate units.

### Question 1(c) [6 Marks]

If the sine wave in part (b) above was sampled at 10kHz, what would be the first 3 sample values?

### Question 1(d) [8 Marks]

A system generates a 2V peak to peak square wave with a period of 1ms.  Sketch the frequency spectrum of the system output.

## Question 2 [Total Marks: 25]

### Question 2(a) [4 Marks]

Explain the difference between the bit rate and the baud of a system

### Question 2(b) [5 Marks]

A system transmits at a bit rate of 1Gbps using 16 signalling levels per symbol.  What is the baud of the system?

### Question 2(c) [4 Marks]

A low pass channel has a bandwidth of 200kHz.  Assuming zero noise, what is the maximum capacity of this channel?

### Question 2(d) [12 Marks]

>Figure 2(d) – Transmission system

A data transmission system launches 45mW of power into a cable from transmitter, TX.  The cable is 20km in length and has a loss of 2.5dB per kilometre.  The signal is then amplified using an amplifier with 10db gain before being transmitted via a second cable of length 10km with a loss of 2dB per kilometre. What is the received power level in watts at Rx?

## Question 3 [Total Marks: 25]

### Question 3(a) [10 Marks]

Draw the constellation diagram for the following modulation schemes:

1. ASK with peak amplitude values of 1V and 3V.
2. QPSK with a peak amplitude value of 1V and any suitable phases.

Ensure that the axes of all diagrams are labelled to show signal amplitudes.

### Question 3(b) [6 Marks]

How many bits can fit on a 1.5km link if the propagation speed is 2.4 x $10^{8}$ m/sec and the bit rate is 25Mb/sec? 

### Question 3(c) [9 Marks]

A data transmission scheme is to transmit the following binary data stream:  

$$01 \ 1100\ 1010$$

Assume the last signal level has been positive.  Draw the graph of the output signal for the following coding schemes:

1. Manchester
2. AMI
3. NRZ-L

## Question 4 [Total Marks: 25]

### Question 4(a) [4 Marks]

What is the main advantage of Return to Zero (RZ) line coding schemes, for example Manchester Encoding, over Non-Return to Zero (NRZ) line coding schemes such as NRZ-I?  How is this advantage achieved?

### Question 4(b) [2 Marks]

Calculate the RMS Voltage of the following sine wave:  

$$V(t) = 312sin(314t + 1.1\text{rad})$$

### Question 4(c) [9 Marks]

Write brief notes explaining any **three** of the following wireless terms:

1. Atmospheric absorption
2. Multipath
3. Reflection
4. Scattering
5. Inter-symbol interference (ISI)

### Question 4(d) [10 Marks]

## Question 5 [Total Marks: 25]

### Question 5(a) [2 Marks]

Explain the meaning of the term "antenna reciprocity".

### Question 5(b) [5 Marks]

Explain the term counterpoise as used in antenna design and outline how one could be constructed.

### Question 5(c) [10 Marks]

Calculate the bandwidth of a 10mm x 12mm planar antenna.

### Question 5(d) [5 Marks]
